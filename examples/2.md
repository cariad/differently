# "differently" example file

To run this example, install `differently` then run:

```bash
differently 1.md 2.md
```

This line says "bar" in 2.md.

Now, a deletion:

The line above should appear in 1.md but deleted in
the diff because it's not in 2.md.

And finally, this next line doesn't exist in 1.md but
should be added in the diff because it's in 2.md:

Hello from 2.md.
